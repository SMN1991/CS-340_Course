# CS-340_Course
Portfolio for SNHU's CS-340 Client/Server Development, taken May - June 2023, focused on learning Full-Stack Development with Python, Juypter Notebook, Dash, and MongoDB.

*How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?*

The CRUD module was a highly reusable script that I can easily see being extended into an even more useful tool. By having all of the needed CRUD functions in one script I used the same module, with little changes after it was originally built, multiple times. This code could be added to, with functions made for more unique use cases to further extended the usefulness of this code. One could also further implement OOP programming within this module to increase its usefulness and security.


*How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?*

Identifying and examining the requirements is my first step in approaching a problem as a computer scientist. For each assignment in this class I looked for the requirements and planned what I needed to accomplish with the additional code created or database management required. I learned this technique in past class and have not only implemented it into my coursework but my life in general when approaching any problems or tasks. Regardless of whether it be a future class, professional assignment or task in my personal life I expect that I will continue to do so, with further refinement being in the exact how I do so, rather than what I do in approaching a task or problem.


*What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientist study, design, and develop the software and hardware used to solve problems and fill needs for people. They allow people to improve their lives, both personal and professional, with technology. In the case of this project it allows a person, or persons, the ability to sift through vast amounts of data the identity specific data that is relevant to their needs or questions. The project in this case improved the speed and accuracy of the data needing to be analyzed.
